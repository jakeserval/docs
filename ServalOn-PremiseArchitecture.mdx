title: "Serval On-Premise Architecture"
---

**Overview**

Serval can be configured to run in a hybrid cloud / on-premise architecture. In this configuration, sensitive API access is handled entirely by on-premise components, while data is stored and encrypted at rest in Serval’s cloud deployment. Overall this minimizes the number of components which need to be maintained on-premise, while ensuring there is no access to sensitive APIs from Serval’s cloud environment.

**Component Details**

There are three key components that are built and deployed by the customer. Serval will provide the build instructions and relevant Kubernetes configuration for these:

- Workers — These are responsible for executing workflow code and interacting with external APIs.
- Proxy Server — Responsible for encrypting and decrypting sensitive API credentials using a customer owned key (e.g. AWS KMS key). Also proxying requests made by workers and injecting the necessary credentials.
- Signing Server — Responsible ensuring workflow code is signed correctly using a customer managed key.

The diagram below outlines how all the different components interact:\

Here, Workers deployed by the customer will do the following:

- Speak to Serval cloud to request any updates to workflow definitions:
  - If there are any updates, they will download the new definitions and check that those definitions have been signed with the customer managed key using the Signing Server.
- Speak to Serval cloud to request any workflows to run:
  - If there are workflows to run, then workers will execute them and send the results back to Serval cloud.
  - Any requests made during these workflows runs will be proxied via the Proxy Server. The proxy server will have access to third-party API credentials that have been encrypted using the customer managed key. It will inject the correct credentials into a given request based on the integration ID and the request destination. Note that the encrypted credentials will be stored in Serval cloud to minimize state stored on-premise.
  - Requests are made directly from the Proxy Server to the given API. Internal APIs can therefore be exposed only to the Proxy Server but still made accessible via workflows.

**Updating Workflows and Credentials**

Workflow definition updates will be made using the Serval web-application. However, the browser will need to be configured to speak to the signing server to sign any updates. Access to the signing server should be controlled using a customer managed, private VPN.

This is the same for updating credentials — New credentials will need to be encrypted using a customer managed key via the signing server and then sent to the Serval cloud environment in an encrypted form.

**Logging**

Note that all components will log all important operations, this includes at least:

- ID and success / failure state of any initiated workflow. This will also include the user ID who initiated the workflow.
- ID and success / failure state of any workflow step.
- All external API requests (location service, integration ID, body, response).
- User ID and workflow information for any signing requests.
- User ID and integration ID for any requests to encrypt new credentials.
- Integration ID for any decrypt operations.

**Additional Notes**

- If a Slack help-desk connection is required, then the connection token will be stored in Serval cloud and encrypted using a Serval managed key. This is so that help-desk messages can be sent to Slack from Serval cloud.
- Workers authenticate with Serval cloud initially using an API key. The authentication process returns a short-lived JWT which is used for subsequent requests and refreshed periodically.
