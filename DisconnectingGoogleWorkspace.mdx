If you have used the OAuth flow to integrate Serval with Google Workspace, sometimes it can be useful to clear the connection completely to start the auth flow from a clean state. To fully disconnect Serval and Google workspace:

- In Serval, visit Applications then select your Google Workspace account. Click the trash icon to delete the connection (don’t worry, data other than integration credentials will be retained if you need it again later).
- To disconnect Google Workspace from Serval, you can do so using your _personal_ account settings.
- Visit [google.com](http://google.com), then select your profile icon and “Manage your Google account”:

- Then “Delete all Connections you have with Serval”:

- You have now reset the connection between Serval and Google Workspace to a clean state. If you wish to reconnect, you will be taken back throw the auth process as if you were connecting for the first time.
