title: "Google Workspace Service Account Configuration"
description: "Description of your new file."

We offer two different configuration mechanisms for Google Workspace:

- Standard OAuth integration:
  - This is preferable if you want a simple integration process and don’t need access to APIs that require a service account and domain-wide delegation.
- Service Account integration:
  - This requires more manual configuration steps, but lets you directly control the scopes Serval has access to and gives you access to some APIs that require a service account and domain-wide delegation.
  - Example APIs that you can access with this method are the [Gmail delegation APIs](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.settings.delegates/create).

To get started with Google Workspace integration, navigate to the “Apps” page and click “Connect to Google Workspace”. You will be presented with this selection:

Select “Authorize with Google” to use the standard OAuth flow. Select “Use Service Account” to use a service account integration.

**Service Account Integration Steps**

- You will be presented with the following inputs:

![Image(11) Pn](/images/image\(11\).png)

- Your first step should be to create a new Google Service Account.
- Navigate to [console.cloud.google.com](http://console.cloud.google.com) and login to the organization you wish to connect.
- Click “Select Project” \> “New Project”

![Image(13) Pn](/images/image\(13\).png)

- Navigate to your new project once created and then to “Enable APIs & Services”

![Image(14) Pn](/images/image\(14\).png)

- Then “Enable APIs and Services”

![Image(15) Pn](/images/image\(15\).png)

- Select APIs you want to enable, e.g.:
  - Admin SDK API
  - Gmail API
- Navigate to “Credentials” \> “Create Credentials” \> “Service Account”

![Image(16) Pn](/images/image\(16\).png)

- Name your service account, then continue all the way through to creating the service account (you do not need to enter anything into the other sections).
- Once the service account is created, navigate to the Service account \> Permissions \> Grant Access

![Image(17) Pn](/images/image\(17\).png)

- In principles, enter the following: `serval@serval-424322.iam.gserviceaccount.com` . This is the Service Account owned and used by Serval cloud services.
- Assign the “Service Account Token Creator” role

- If you receive the following error message, you will need to permit Serval to access your domain:

![Image(19) Pn](/images/image\(19\).png)

- Follow [this guide](https://www.notion.so/Google-Workspace-Service-Account-Configuration-1035b4e67d268039b84bf473a6c081ab?pvs=21) to grant access.
- Once you have given the Serval owned Service Account access to your newly created Service Account, our Service Account will be able to act as if it were your Service Account.
- Next, you need to give your newly created service account “Domain-Wide Delegated Access”.
- Navigate to your Service account “Details” \> “Advanced Settings” \> Copy the “Client ID” value \> “View Google Workspace Admin Console”

![Image(20) Pn](/images/image\(20\).png)

- In Google Workspace, navigate to “Security” \> “Access and data control” \> “API controls” \> “Manage Domain Wide Delegation”

![Image(21) Pn](/images/image\(21\).png)

- Select “Add New”
- Enter the Client ID for your Service Account (copied from the “Advanced Settings” dropdown area in service account details).
- Enter scopes according to operations you wish to perform. For example, the following list of scopes would allow you to manage users, groups and also Gmail settings for your users:

`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user,<https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.member,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.sharing,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`[\>](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.member,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.sharing,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar)

- **IMPORTANT —** In addition to these scopes, please also include the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`. Without this scope we will not be able to assume access to accounts in your domain.
- Finally, return to Serval and enter the following:
  - Your Google Workspace domain
  - The email address for the service account you created.
  - A default subject — This should be an admin user in your domain that will be used for admin API calls.
  - The comma-separated list of scopes that you enabled when configuring domain wide delegation.
- Click Save.
- You should now build a workflow to test out the integration.

**Allowing Serval as a Permitted Domain**

- Navigate to “IAM & Admin” \> Organization Policies:

![Image(23) Pn](/images/image\(23\).png)

- Search for `allowedPolicyMemberDomains`
- Select the policy (named “Domain Restricted Sharing”)
- Select “Manage Policy”
- Select “Override Parent’s Policy” and “Merge with Parent”

![Image(24) Pn](/images/image\(24\).png)

- Create a new custom “Allow” rule and enter C04gvbkuc as the value. This ensures the Serval domain is whitelisted.

![Image(25) Pn](/images/image\(25\).png)

- Click Save
- You should now be able to grant the Serval owned service account access to your newly created service account.
