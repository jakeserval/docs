**Obtaining Credentials**

Contact the Serval team to obtain API credentials using your shared Slack channel. They will distribute API credentials to you consisting of a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

**Generating an Access Token**

To obtain an access token, you will need to send a POST request to the [public.api.serval.com/v1/auth/token](http://public.api.serval.com/v1/auth/token) endpoint. In the response, you will receive a token which can be used to make API calls.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the request parameters:

- **Authorization Header**: This contains the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, encoded in base64. The format is Authorization: Basic `<base64(client_id:client_secret)>`.
- **Content-Type**: Set this to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- **grant_type**: This should be set to client_credentials for this flow.

Here is an example request:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://public.api.serval.com/v1/auth/token' \
    --header "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" | base64)" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
    --data "grant_type=client_credentials"
```

In the response, you will receive an access token:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<a_temporary_access_token>",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 259200
}
```

**Make your first API Call**

With your `access_token`, you’re ready to make your first API call. Here’s an example of retrieving tickets for a given team for a given time period:

```json
curl \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    'https://public.api.serval.com/teams/{team_id}/tickets?startTime=2025-02-18T13:42:00.804756Z&endTime=2025-02-19T13:42:00.804757Z'
```

Example response:

```json
