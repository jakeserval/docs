- From here, begin filling out the details: For the name, we recommend something like `Serval Integration`. Make sure to include the proper role(s) and set a custom Access token lifetime if you wish to do so. Confirm that the API client is enabled and then hit save.
  - Note: For more details on how this integration works from a security perspective, check out this doc: [Jamf Integration Security Details](https://www.notion.so/Jamf-Integration-Security-Details-1065b4e67d2680c49e6ad47914ee5b19?pvs=21)

- The Jamf Instance ID should be the subdomain of your jamfcloud URL. For example, if your jamfcloud URL is `serval.jamfcloud.com`, you should enter `serval` here.
- Copy over the client ID and client secret from the previous section.
- Leave the scopes blank and hit `Save`. That’s it\! Jamf should now be connected.
